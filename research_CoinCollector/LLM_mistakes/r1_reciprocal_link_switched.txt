      "content": "You are \u201cCoin-Seeker-R1\u201d, an efficient text-only agent in the TextWorld Coin-Collector game. \nCoin-Collector is a text-based adventure game where you are in a randomly generated maze and must find the coin. \nThe user will tell you which room you are in and what do you observe, and you need to explore different rooms to find the target object.\n\nYour goal: find the coin within 100 moves.\nAvailable commands: `go north`, `go east`, `go south`, `go west`, `take coin`.\nYou can only `take coin` if you see the coin in the room.\n\nTo help you win the game, this the strategy that you must follow:\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 Strategy \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n1. **Build a mental map.**  \n   \u2022 Keep an internal table like  \n     `MAP = {room_name_1: {exits:{N:?,E:?,S:?,W:?}}, room_name_2: {exits:{N:?,E:?,S:?,W:?}}, ...}`\n     N, E, S, W represent north, east, south, west, and A \u201c?\u201d means you haven\u2019t tried that exit yet.\n     Be concise, one line per room.\n   \u2022 Maintain a `PATH = {room_A, room_B, ...}` stack of the rooms you travelled through.\n\n2. **Update map when you arrive in a new room.**  \n   \u2022 When you arrive in a new room and get an observation, extract:\n       `room`  : the room\u2019s name (first line of the observation)  \n       `exits` : the list of exits mentioned in the observation\n   \u2022 Update the MAP :\n       \u2022 You should first copy your last MAP, PATH from the previous step and \n         then update information based on the current observation.    \n       \u2022 Update the `exits` of the current room based on the observation. \n         If an exit is not mentioned in the observation, mark it as `Invalid`.\n       \u2022 fill in the reciprocal link between the previous room and the new one so corridors are two-way. \n         Example: If your last location is Room A and last action is `go south`,\n                  and now you observe that your in in Room B, then obviously you should have\n                  `{Room A: {exits:{S:Room B, ...}, ...},Room B: {exits:{N:Room A, ...}, ...}}`.\n   \u2022 Update the PATH :\n       \u2022 Push current room on `PATH`\n\n3. **Depth-first search (DFS) with backtracking.**  \n   Step rule:  \n   a. If `coin` is mentioned in the observation \u2192 `action = \"take coin\"` and stop.  \n   b. Else, check the `exits` of the current room:  \n      - Choose the first unexplored exit (i.e. leads to unvisited room) in the fixed order N, E, S, W.  \n        set `action = \"go <direction>\"`.  \n   c. If no unexplored exits remain \u2192 pop the last room from `PATH`  \n      then set `action` to the direction to return to the last room in `PATH`.\n   d. Repeat until coin taken or 80 steps exhausted.\n\n4. **Output format.**  \n   ```\n   <scratch-pad>\n   your MAP, PATH, your NOTES\n   </scratch-pad>\n   <|ACTION|>action<|END|>       with `action` from `go north | go east | go south | go west | take coin`\n   ```\n\n5. **Checklist.**\n   In every step, after write down MAP, PATH, double check everything.\n     Here is a checklist: \n     - C1: Which room I am currently in? What are the available exits? Which room did I come from?\n     - C2: Did I copy previous MAP, PATH correctly? Did I update the reciprocal link the current <--> previous room with opposite direction correctly?\n     - C3: Do I have any missing information in MAP, PATH, and no abbreviation? \n     - C4: Am I following the DFS strategy? Or am I in the process of error recovery?\n     Write down your answer to ALL of the above questions in the NOTES in the scratch-pad:\n\n6. **Discipline, Responsibility and Error Recovery.** \n   \u2022 The GOLD RULE for the game : in every step, in your `scratch-pad`, you must always \n     keep a complete MAP of all visited rooms and their exits from previous observations. \n     NEVER discard or compress any information in the MAP, PATH. NEVER use any abbreviation in the MAP, PATH (such as \"...\"). \n     If you ever find any missing information in the MAP, PATH, your highest priority is to complete \n     the MAP based on previous steps. NEVER mindlessly explore without a MAP.\n   \u2022 Error Recovery:\n     Seeing anything unexpected means you might have made a mistaken and possibly ruined the DFS strategy.\n     In such a case, instead of following the DFS strategy mindlessly, you should try to understand the mistake and try to recover from the mistake.\n     Here are some common mistakes and how to recover:\n     - If you see 'That's not a verb I recognise', it means your last action is not valid and you are still in the same room.\n     - If you see 'You can't go that way', it means your last choice of direction is not valid and you are still in the same room.\n     The game setup is absolutely correct. If you can't find the coin, you must have made mistakes.\n     In the worse scenario, if you really can't figure out the mistake, you may discard all previous MAP, PATH and start over from the current room.\n\n\nGood luck, Coin-Seeker-R1!"

The user is currently in the Scullery room. The exits here are east, north, south, and west. According to the previous MAP and PATH, I need to check which exits have been explored and which haven't. \n\nThe strategy is DFS, so the agent should choose the first unexplored exit in the order N, E, S, W. The last action was going west from Bedchamber to Scullery, so the west exit of Scullery would lead back to Bedchamber. But since the user just arrived in Scullery, all exits except west (since that's how they came in) might be unexplored. Wait, no, the west exit was the way they entered, so the reciprocal link would be Scullery's west connected to Bedchamber's east. But the current observation mentions exits east, north, south, west. So the agent should check each in order.\n\nFirst, check north. If it's unexplored, go north. Otherwise, check east, then south, then west. Since this is the first time in Scullery, all exits except maybe west (if west is the path back) are marked as '?'. Wait, in the MAP, Scullery's exits would be initialized with N, E, S, W as '?' except for the reciprocal link. Since the agent came from west (Bedchamber to Scullery via east), Scullery's west exit would be marked as Bedchamber. So the exits in Scullery's MAP entry would be: N: ?, E: ?, S: ?, W: Bedchamber. \n\nBut the current observation lists all four exits as available. So the agent should first attempt north, then east, then south, then west. Since the coin hasn't been found yet, the next action should be 'go north' as the first unexplored direction.
