      "content": "You are \u201cCoin-Seeker-R1\u201d, an efficient text-only agent in the TextWorld Coin-Collector game. \nCoin-Collector is a text-based adventure game where you are in a randomly generated maze and must find the coin. \nThe user will tell you which room you are in and what do you observe, and you need to explore different rooms to find the target object.\n\nYour goal: find the coin within 80 moves.\nAvailable commands: `go north`, `go east`, `go south`, `go west`, `take coin`.\nYou can only `take coin` if you see the coin in the room.\n\nTo help you win the game, this the strategy that you must follow:\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 Strategy \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n1. **Build a mental map.**  \n   \u2022 Keep an internal table like  \n     `MAP = {room_name_1: {exits:{N:?,E:?,S:?,W:?}}, room_name_2: {exits:{N:?,E:?,S:?,W:?}}, ...}`\n     N, E, S, W represent north, east, south, west, and A \u201c?\u201d means you haven\u2019t tried that exit yet.\n     Be concise, one line per room.\n   \u2022 Maintain a `PATH = {room_A, room_B, ...}` stack of the rooms you travelled through.\n\n2. **Update map when you arrive in a new room.**  \n   \u2022 When you arrive in a new room and get an observation, extract:\n       `room`  : the room\u2019s name (first line of the observation)  \n       `exits` : the list of exits mentioned in the observation\n   \u2022 Update the MAP :\n       \u2022 You should first copy your last MAP, PATH from the previous step and \n         then update information based on the current observation.    \n       \u2022 Update the `exits` of the current room based on the observation. \n         If an exit is not mentioned in the observation, mark it as `Invalid`.\n       \u2022 fill in the reciprocal link between the previous room and the new one so corridors are two-way. \n         Example: If your last location is Room A and last action is `go south`,\n                  and now you observe that your in in Room B, then obviously you should have\n                  `{Room A: {exits:{S:Room B, ...}, ...},Room B: {exits:{N:Room A, ...}, ...}}`.\n   \u2022 Update the PATH :\n       \u2022 Push current room on `PATH`\n\n3. **Depth-first search (DFS) with backtracking.**  \n   Step rule:  \n   a. If `coin` is mentioned in the observation \u2192 `action = \"take coin\"` and stop.  \n   b. Else, check the `exits` of the current room:  \n      - Choose the first unexplored exit (i.e. leads to unvisited room) in the fixed order N, E, S, W.  \n        set `action = \"go <direction>\"`.  \n   c. If no unexplored exits remain \u2192 pop the last room from `PATH`  \n      then set `action` to the direction to return to the last room in `PATH`.\n   d. Repeat until coin taken or 80 steps exhausted.\n\n4. **Output format.**  \n   ```\n   <scratch-pad>\n   your MAP, PATH, your NOTES\n   </scratch-pad>\n   <|ACTION|>action<|END|>       with `action` from `go north | go east | go south | go west | take coin`\n   ```\n   \n5. **Discipline, Responsibility and Error Recovery.** \n   \u2022 The GOLD RULE for the game : in every step, in your `scratch-pad`, you must always \n     keep a complete MAP of all visited rooms and their exits from previous observations. \n     NEVER discard or compress any information in the MAP, PATH. NEVER use any abbreviation in the MAP, PATH. \n     If you ever find any missing information in the MAP, PATH, your highest priority is to complete \n     the MAP based on previous steps. NEVER mindlessly explore without a MAP.\n   \u2022 In every step, prepare a tentantive output in your thinking process and double check it.\n     Your checklist: \n     - Did I copied previous MAP, PATH correctly, and updated it correctly?\n     - Which room I am currently in? What are the available exits?\n     - Am I following the DFS strategy? Or am I in the process of error recovery?\n     - Is there anything unexpected or inconsistent?\n     You can try to write NOTES in your scratch-pad (for your future reference) for checklists, strategies, error recovery, etc.\n   \u2022 Error Recovery:\n     Seeing anything unexpected means you might have made a mistaken and possibly ruined the DFS strategy.\n     In such a case, instead of following the DFS strategy mindlessly, you should try to understand the mistake and try to recover from the mistake.\n     Here are some common mistakes and how to recover:\n     - If you see 'That's not a verb I recognise', it means your last action is not valid and you are still in the same room.\n     - If you see 'You can't go that way', it means your last choice of direction is not valid and you are still in the same room.\n     The game setup is absolutely correct. If you can't find the coin, you must have made mistakes.\n     In the worse scenario, if you really can't figure out the mistake, you may discard all previous MAP, PATH and start over from the current room.\n\n\nGood luck, Coin-Seeker-R1!"

So, the current room is Parlor, and the exits mentioned are east, north, south, and west. The previous room was Scullery, where I went south to get here.\n\nFirst, I need to update the MAP and PATH. The Parlor is a new room connected to Scullery via the south exit. So, in the MAP under Scullery, the south exit should now point to Parlor. And in Parlor\'s exits, north would point back to Scullery. Then, I need to check the available exits here in Parlor: east, north, south, west.\n\nAccording to the DFS strategy, I should explore exits in the order of north, east, south, west. But wait, since I just arrived here by going south from Scullery, the first unexplored exit should be north. Let me check the observation again. The Parlor has exits north, east, south, west. The user says "You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north." So north is an option. Since I haven\'t explored north yet, that\'s the first direction I should go.\n\nSo the next action should be "go north". That way, I\'m following the DFS strategy by taking the first unexplored exit in order. Let me make sure I\'m not missing anything. The PATH should now include Parlor, and the MAP should be updated with Parlor\'s exits. But since I\'m moving north from Parlor, I need to check if north is valid. The observation says north is an unguarded exit, so it\'s valid. \n\nTherefore, the action is "go north".'))], created=1748095874, model='deepseek-reasoner', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='fp_5417b77867_prod0425fp8', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=533, prompt_tokens=37198, total_tokens=37731, completion_tokens_details=CompletionTokensDetails(accepted_prediction_tokens=None, audio_tokens=None, reasoning_tokens=350, rejected_prediction_tokens=None), prompt_tokens_details=PromptTokensDetails(audio_tokens=None, cached_tokens=36800), prompt_cache_hit_tokens=36800, prompt_cache_miss_tokens=398))
