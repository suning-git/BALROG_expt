      "content": "You are \u201cCoin-Seeker-R1\u201d, an efficient text-only agent in the TextWorld Coin-Collector game. \nCoin-Collector is a text-based adventure game where you are in a randomly generated maze and must find the coin. \nThe user will tell you which room you are in and what do you observe, and you need to explore different rooms to find the target object.\n\nYour goal: find the coin within 100 moves.\nAvailable commands: `go north`, `go east`, `go south`, `go west`, `take coin`.\nYou can only `take coin` if you see the coin in the room.\n\nTo help you win the game, this the strategy that you must follow:\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 Strategy \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n1. **Build a mental map.**  \n   \u2022 Keep an internal table like  \n     `MAP = {room_name_1: {exits:{N:?,E:?,S:?,W:?}}, room_name_2: {exits:{N:?,E:?,S:?,W:?}}, ...}`\n     N, E, S, W represent north, east, south, west, and A \u201c?\u201d means you haven\u2019t tried that exit yet.\n     Be concise, one line per room.\n   \u2022 Maintain a `PATH = {room_A, room_B, ...}` stack of the rooms you travelled through.\n\n2. **Update map when you arrive in a new room.**  \n   \u2022 When you arrive in a new room and get an observation, extract:\n       `room`  : the room\u2019s name (first line of the observation)  \n       `exits` : the list of exits mentioned in the observation\n   \u2022 Update the MAP :\n       \u2022 You should first copy your last MAP, PATH from the previous step and \n         then update information based on the current observation.    \n       \u2022 Update the `exits` of the current room based on the observation. \n         If an exit is not mentioned in the observation, mark it as `Invalid`.\n       \u2022 fill in the reciprocal link between the previous room and the new one so corridors are two-way. \n         Example: If your last location is Room A and last action is `go south`,\n                  and now you observe that your in in Room B, then obviously you should have\n                  `{Room A: {exits:{S:Room B, ...}, ...},Room B: {exits:{N:Room A, ...}, ...}}`.\n   \u2022 Update the PATH :\n       \u2022 Push current room on `PATH`\n\n3. **Depth-first search (DFS) with backtracking.**  \n   Step rule:  \n   a. If `coin` is mentioned in the observation \u2192 `action = \"take coin\"` and stop.  \n   b. Else, check the `exits` of the current room:  \n      - Choose the first unexplored exit (i.e. leads to unvisited room) in the fixed order N, E, S, W.  \n        set `action = \"go <direction>\"`.  \n   c. If no unexplored exits remain \u2192 pop the last room from `PATH`  \n      then set `action` to the direction to return to the last room in `PATH`.\n   d. Repeat until coin taken or 80 steps exhausted.\n\n4. **Output format.**  \n   ```\n   <scratch-pad>\n   your MAP, PATH, your NOTES\n   </scratch-pad>\n   <|ACTION|>action<|END|>       with `action` from `go north | go east | go south | go west | take coin`\n   ```\n\n5. **Checklist.**\n   In every step, after write down MAP, PATH, double check everything.\n     Here is a checklist: \n     - C1: Which room I am currently in? What are the available exits? Which room did I come from?\n     - C2: Did I copy previous MAP, PATH correctly? Did I update the reciprocal link the current <--> previous room with opposite direction correctly?\n     - C3: Do I have any missing information in MAP, PATH, and no abbreviation? \n     - C4: Am I following the DFS strategy? Or am I in the process of error recovery?\n     Write down your answer to ALL of the above questions in the NOTES in the scratch-pad:\n\n6. **Discipline, Responsibility and Error Recovery.** \n   \u2022 The GOLD RULE for the game : in every step, in your `scratch-pad`, you must always \n     keep a complete MAP of all visited rooms and their exits from previous observations. \n     NEVER discard or compress any information in the MAP, PATH. NEVER use any abbreviation in the MAP, PATH (such as \"...\"). \n     If you ever find any missing information in the MAP, PATH, your highest priority is to complete \n     the MAP based on previous steps. NEVER mindlessly explore without a MAP.\n   \u2022 Error Recovery:\n     Seeing anything unexpected means you might have made a mistaken and possibly ruined the DFS strategy.\n     In such a case, instead of following the DFS strategy mindlessly, you should try to understand the mistake and try to recover from the mistake.\n     Here are some common mistakes and how to recover:\n     - If you see 'That's not a verb I recognise', it means your last action is not valid and you are still in the same room.\n     - If you see 'You can't go that way', it means your last choice of direction is not valid and you are still in the same room.\n     The game setup is absolutely correct. If you can't find the coin, you must have made mistakes.\n     In the worse scenario, if you really can't figure out the mistake, you may discard all previous MAP, PATH and start over from the current room.\n\n\nGood luck, Coin-Seeker-R1!"

No coin observed. No abbreviations in MAP.\nC4: Following DFS - first unexplored exit is north (fixed order N→E→S→W).\n</scratch-pad>\n<|ACTION|>go north<|END|>", refusal=None, role='assistant', annotations=None, audio=None, function_call=None, tool_calls=None, reasoning_content='Okay, let\'s see. The user is in the Fun Recreation Zone now. First, I need to update the MAP and PATH based on this new observation. \n\nThe current room is Fun Recreation Zone. The exits mentioned are east, north, south, and west. Since they came from Silent Studio via the south exit (since the last action was \'go south\' from Silent Studio), I should link Silent Studio\'s south to this new room and vice versa.\n\nSo, adding \'Fun Recreation Zone\' to the MAP with exits: N: ?, E: ?, S: ?, W: Silent Studio. Then, update Silent Studio\'s S exit to point to Fun Recreation Zone. \n\nNow, check the PATH. The last rooms were Bathroom, Salon, Workshop, Playroom, Austere Workshop, Silent Studio. Now, adding Fun Recreation Zone to the PATH.\n\nNext, following DFS strategy. The exits in order N, E, S, W. The first unexplored exit is north. So the action should be \'go north\'.\n\nMake sure all reciprocal links are correct. Also, check if any exits are missing. The current observation mentions all four directions, so mark any exits not mentioned as Invalid. But in this case, all exits are mentioned as valid. So in the MAP, set N, E, S, W to ? initially except for W which connects back to Silent Studio.\n\nWait, the user came from Silent Studio via south, so the exit back would be north. So Fun Recreation Zone\'s W should link to Silent Studio? Wait, no. If the user went south from Silent Studio to arrive here, then the reciprocal exit from Fun Recreation Zone to Silent Studio should be north. Because moving south from Silent Studio leads here, so moving north from here leads back to Silent Studio. Wait, direction reciprocals: if you go south from Room A to Room B, then Room B\'s north exit leads back to Room A. So in this case, Silent Studio\'s S exit is Fun Recreation Zone, and Fun Recreation Zone\'s N exit should be Silent Studio. But the current observation says there\'s an exit north in Fun Recreation Zone. Wait, but according to the game\'s mechanics, if you went south to get here, the north exit would lead back. But the observation says there\'s an unblocked exit to the north, which might be a different room. Wait, no, maybe the game has a different layout. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nWait, maybe the user\'s movement from Silent Studio south leads to Fun Recreation Zone, so the north exit of Fun Recreation Zone should lead back to Silent Studio. But the observation says there\'s an exit north here, which is unblocked. So perhaps the north exit is a new room. Wait, that can\'t be right. Because if you go south from Silent Studio to get here, then the north exit here should lead back to Silent Studio. But the game\'s description might have multiple exits. So perhaps the room has multiple valid exits, and the north exit is a new room. But that would create a loop. Hmm, maybe the game allows for multiple paths. \n\nWait, the key is to follow the observation\'s exits. The current room has exits N, E, S, W. The user arrived here via south from Silent Studio, so the reciprocal exit (north here) would lead back to Silent Studio. But according to the game\'s observation, the north exit is unblocked. So in the MAP, for Fun Recreation Zone, N is a valid exit but hasn\'t been explored yet. So mark it as \'?\'. Similarly for E, S, W. But the W exit is mentioned as unguarded. Wait, the observation says: "You don\'t like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded." So west is a valid exit. But where does west lead? Since the user came from Silent Studio via south, west might lead to a new room. But according to the reciprocal direction, west here should not be connected to Silent Studio. Because the user came from south, so the return is north. So west is a separate exit. Therefore, in the MAP, Fun Recreation Zone\'s W is marked as ? because it\'s unexplored. \n\nSo updating the MAP accordingly. Now, following DFS, the next move should be the first unexplored exit in N, E, S, W order. So north is first, so action is \'go north\'. \n\nBut need to make sure that in the MAP, the Silent Studio\'s S exit is set to Fun Recreation Zone, and Fun Recreation Zone\'s N exit is set to Silent Studio. Wait, no. Because if the user moved south from Silent Studio to get here, then Fun Recreation Zone\'s N should lead back to Silent Studio. But the observation says there\'s an exit north, which is unblocked, implying it\'s a valid exit. So perhaps the N exit here is a new room, not the one they came from. That would mean the game\'s layout isn\'t strictly grid-based, which is possible. Therefore, the MAP should reflect that moving south from Silent Studio leads to Fun Recreation Zone, and the N exit here is a new, unexplored room. Therefore, in the MAP, Silent Studio\'s S is set to Fun Recreation Zone, and Fun Recreation Zone\'s N is \'?\', to be explored. \n\nIn that case, the next action is \'go north\' to explore that exit. So the action should be \'go north\'.'))], created=1748132083, model='deepseek-reasoner', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='fp_5417b77867_prod0425fp8', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=1641, prompt_tokens=7980, total_tokens=9621, completion_tokens_details=CompletionTokensDetails(accepted_prediction_tokens=None, audio_tokens=None, reasoning_tokens=1127, rejected_prediction_tokens=None), prompt_tokens_details=PromptTokensDetails(audio_tokens=None, cached_tokens=7296), prompt_cache_hit_tokens=7296, prompt_cache_miss_tokens=684))
