0,Bathroom,write_memory(Playbook),"Playbook:
- Overall Strategy: Use a DFS algorithm to explore the maze until reaching the kitchen, where the coin is located. Only 'take coin' when an observation explicitly mentions the coin.
- Key Memory reads: 
   * 'Playbook' - to load the current strategy.
   * 'Notes' - to check any additional instructions or hints.
   * 'Visited' - list of visited rooms (to be maintained) to avoid re-visiting.
   * 'Stack' - DFS stack for rooms/directions to explore.
- Key Memory writes:
   * 'Playbook' - updated in every round if needed.
   * 'Notes' - additional notes for future rounds.
   * 'Visited' - updated with the current room after moving.
   * 'Stack' - updated with potential moves/directions.
- Initial Step: We're in the bathroom with multiple unguarded exits. The coin is in the kitchen. Decide on an order for exploration (e.g., east, north, west, then south if applicable) and mark visited.
- In each round: Read 'Playbook' and 'Notes', update visited rooms, and choose a move based on DFS.

Future Self: This playbook is our operating procedure for exploring the maze and collecting the coin in the kitchen. Stick to DFS, and only pick up the coin when explicitly observed. Review this plan each round.",
0,Bathroom,write_memory(Notes),"Initial Notes:
- Currently in the Bathroom with exits: east, north, and west.
- Plan: Follow DFS. Start by exploring east as our first move in search of the kitchen containing the coin.
- Add this room to 'Visited' list when appropriate.",
