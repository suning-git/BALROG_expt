   - 'Coin_Status': Track whether the coin has been collected ('Collected' or 'Not Collected').
   - 'Path_Taken': Log the sequence of moves to backtrack if needed.

2. **Round-by-Round Plan**:
   - **Round 1**: Read 'Current_Location' and 'Exits' to understand the environment. Write 'Bathroom' to 'Current_Location' and ['north', 'east', 'west'] to 'Exits'.
   - **Round 2**: Choose an exit (e.g., 'east') to move towards the kitchen. Update 'Path_Taken' with the chosen direction.
   - **Round 3**: Upon entering the kitchen, check for the coin. If present, 'take coin' and update 'Coin_Status' to 'Collected'.
   - **Round 4**: If the coin is not in the kitchen, backtrack using 'Path_Taken' and explore other exits.
