Every turn:
	if quest0 completed is true:
		do nothing;
	else if The player carries the o_0:
		increase the score by 1; [Quest completed]
		if 1 is 1 [always true]:
			Now the quest0 completed is true;

Use scoring. The maximum score is 1.
This is the simpler notify score changes rule:
	If the score is not the last notified score:
		let V be the score - the last notified score;
		if V > 0:
			say "Your score has just gone up by [V in words] ";
		else:
			say "Your score changed by [V in words] ";
		if V >= -1 and V <= 1:

		Now the last notified score is the score;
	if quest0 completed is true:
		end the story finally; [Win]

The simpler notify score changes rule substitutes for the notify score changes rule.
